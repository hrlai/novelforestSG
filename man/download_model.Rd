\title{Download Model Fitted to \code{novelforest_data}}
\usage{
download_model(save_to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{save_to}{Path and name of the file where the R object is saved to.
Defaults to NULL, which does not save the model object locally.}
}
\value{
A \code{brms} model output of class \code{brmsfit},
which is a list containing the input \code{data} and other slots
that store the model components.

Notably, the \code{data} slot contains a \code{data.frame} with the following
response variables:
\describe{
\item{SD_N_0}{first-order native taxonomic diversity, i.e., species richness}
\item{SD_N_2}{second-order native taxonomic diversity, i.e., inverse Simpson index}
\item{SD_E_0}{first-order exotic taxonomic diversity}
\item{SD_E_2}{second-order exotic taxonomic diversity}
\item{FD_N_0}{first-order native functional diversity}
\item{FD_N_2}{second-order native functional diversity}
\item{FD_E_0}{first-order exotic functional diversity}
\item{FD_E_2}{second-order exotic functional diversity,}
}
and the following explanatory variables (and measurement units if you backtransform
them using \code{backtransform}):
\describe{
\item{dist}{Distance to old-growth forests (m)}
\item{size}{Patch area (km^2)}
\item{nitrogen}{Total soil nitrogen (mg/kg)}
\item{phosphorous}{Total extractable soil phosphorous (mg/kg)}
\item{potassium}{Total extractable soil potassium (mg/kg)}
\item{patch}{Forest patch ID}
}

#' Note that all explanatory variables were log-transformed and standardised to zero mean and
unit standard deviations. Use \code{backtransform} to obtain the variables in
their original scales. See Lai et al. (2021) for more details on model building and
data collection.

\description{
Download the \code{brms} model fitted to \code{novelforest_data} (Lai et al. 2021).
The model object is too large (16.5 MB) to be included with the package,
so this function downloads the model from the developmental GitHub website.
The generalised linear mixed-effect model was fitted via \code{brms::brm} so
this package is recommended to make full use of the model object.
