## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Manually replaced `@docType` with `@aliases novelforestSG-package` to 
  accommodate breaking changes in roxygen2
  
Thank you for checking. 

In addition, we included a minor update on the dataset `novelforest_data`. 
As a result, we removed the function `backtransform` since it is no longer 
applicable to the new dataset.
